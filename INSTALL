To install:

  $ make
  # make install

The "make" step is optional and only compiles the modules, translations, and the
mmkeys extension.

There is also an install_no_locale target if you wish to install without 
translations.

Also, if you dont have installed pyclips, you should install it using
 
  $ make pyclips
